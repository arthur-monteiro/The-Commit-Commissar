The Commit Commissar integrates your code and perform some tests to ensure everything is still working as expected.
It uses the [Wolf-Engine 2.0](https://github.com/arthur-monteiro/WolfEngine-2.0).

To set up projects, you need to add a file `config.json` in the `config/` folder. Here an example of the content of the file (use for the Wolf-Engine):

```
{
    "projects": [
        {
            "name": "Wolf Engine",
            "repoURL": "https://github.com/arthur-monteiro/WolfEngine-2.0",
            "sourceBranchName": "dev",
            "targetBranchName": "main",
            "scenario" : {
                "instructions": [
                    {
                        "command": "executeWithResult",
                        "value": "msvc_build.bat"
                    },
                    {
                        "command": "executeWithResult",
                        "value": "Wolf Engine 2.0/compile_android_vulkan.bat"
                    },
                    {
                        "command": "executePythonWithResult",
                        "value": "Graphic Tests/runGraphicTests.py"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
